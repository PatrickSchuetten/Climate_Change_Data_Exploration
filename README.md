# Climate change data exploration

## Objective
* What changes can we observe in the world’s global temperature since the beginning of the 20th century.
* Is there a correlation between countries’ average temperatures and their levels of CO2 emissions?
* Are the different countries of the world equally impacted by the rising temperatures?
* Hypothesis testing : Comparing two different mean rising temperatures from two different countries.
* Hypothesis testing : Comparing the global average temperatures and a specific country average temperatures.
